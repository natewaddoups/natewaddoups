Hello, world!
    
<p>If you like snowboarding (or skiing) there is a <a href="SidecutCalculator.html">sidecut calculator</a> that you might find useful.

<p>If you drive a Subaru, and want to know what's going on in the engine computer, my <a href="https://github.com/natewaddoups/SSM">SSM utilities</a> might be useful.</p>

<p>Back in 2002, I was going to build a robot... but ended up building a <a href="https://github.com/natewaddoups/juice">robot simulator</a> instead.</p>
